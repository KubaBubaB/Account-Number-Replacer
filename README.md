# Account-Number-Replacer
Simple scirpt that detects changes in the clipboard, if it recognizes text that might be account number it replaces it with hard-coded number :)
Works based on winapi, might bug out sometimes and it only checks basic criteria like if text is numbers only or is 26 characters long.
